## Initial idea
*Initial idea / Concept of the Project (aligned to research areas).*

![](https://i.imgur.com/jXhzBgS.jpg)

First, we came together as a group and discussed our common interest.

Based on our previous project, we're interested in exploring **future perception and attitudes of school children**. We have worked on a collage exercise to ask 8-year-olds their perspectives reimagining the future of parks, zoos, schools and sports. Therefore we would like to bring it to another level.

We started to look for inspirations online to design the right prototype for this experiment.

![](https://i.imgur.com/EaKkHwr.jpg)

We had an idea to design a perception map to visualize in an analog way how children and teenagers feel in regards to certain subjects. This tool would be used as a debate prompt and as a data visualization tool.

## Purpose
*What is supposed to do or not to do.*

### What
A "perception board" that allows children and teenagers to **map their sentiments, attitudes and perceptions** around global problems and their potential solutions. 

### Who
Our goal would be to integrate the tool into a session with teenagers (over 13 years old). This is because their capability to reflect on global problems is much more developed than on younger children and we are inspired by debate sessions carried out by children over 13 years old.

### Where

Indoors or classroom settings.

### How

This can be done through a workshop or a small game session with our Artifact. The artifact includes:
- set of question cards
- wooden board
- pointers

### Why
By showing an analog version of their attitudes, this will help because:
- If we ask one same question to a whole class, people will feel differently depending on the topic, their emotions that day and the knowledge they ahve on the subject. So it is helpful to document the sentiments that can also later be compared in future sessions.
- We want to visualize diversity in points of view and exemplify how points of view are flexible and can evolve over time.
- Stresses the important that each thought can be challenged and evolved.
- Teaching kids to express their point of view in a diplomatic and peaceful way respecting each other.
- To create safe spaces for sharing their thoughts
- Because it can stimulate difficult conversations.

## Planification
*Shown how your team planned and executed the project (Explain personal contributions).*

Together as a group with limited time and resources, we made a plan to ensure that everything could be carried out efficiently.

On the first day, we plan to finalize our design concept and test it out on our digital prototype in miro. We designed a 2 question structure for the x and y axis.
- The X axis - Goes from **Not Interested** to **Strongly interested** and answers a sentiment question relating to the present or future of a global problem.
- The Y axis - Goes from **Strongly Disagree** to **Strongly Agree** and answers a solution-based question that proposes a way to fix the global problem shown in the first question (x axis).

On the second day, we prepared the digital files for the game and received feedback from the Fab Lab team. We plan to test it out on a cardboard first before cutting it on the better material: wood panels. Once we test it out and see that everything works, we will proceed to cut it on Thursday. We are planning integrate electronics on that same day as well.

By Friday, we will try to finalize everything so that it is ready for presentation.

In terms of personal contribution, we divided our jobs so that we can work together smoothly based on our strengths.

Wen will be in charge of mainly with project planning, designing the physical artifact, documentation, and the Rhino File preparation.

Ariel is incharge of electronics, to figure out how to fit the LED into the board, and also part of the physical artifact fabrication.

Jimena will be working on the MVP, digital perception board, card and resources design, and also preparing the guides for the game.

As a collective, we execute main jobs such as laser cutting, assembling and testing together.


## Integrated design
*Integrated Design (How you designed it - relation between elements)*

First we looked at some references of board games and participatory design involving children.

Below are some references that served as inspiration.

![](https://i.imgur.com/vrfXUIo.jpg)

We are working in a physical visualization of attitudes and opinions of children. 

It is a simple system, and we just need to place the pointers at the different pieces of wood. The second step will be to integrate lights or another electronic system to our device to reinforce their perceptions and help them with wayfinding on the board.

### Design Process

As a first step, we started with ideation and sketches.

![](https://i.imgur.com/pq8nvYA.jpg)


Then, we build a paper prototype.

![](https://i.imgur.com/CIctE9r.jpg)


After, we build a online digital prototype to test out our concept.

Usability Testing

![](https://i.imgur.com/pBsVJWs.png)

We tried this concept out on the Miro and it works. 

Then, we work out the details and measurements to be prepared for the rhino files. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/67iXb3u.jpg)

### Problems

1. Initially we wanted the design to be a peg hole with board. But we noticed that it is a problem as the same person could not choose the same position. This is the reason why our design evolved from the peg to the pointers that fill in the negative space.
2. Integrating electronics. We want this to be meaningul and not just flashy or integrating because we want to add another fabrication technique. We planned on adding LED lights to help with wayfinding what is a **Positive attitude / Strongly Agree** in green and a **Negative attitude / Strongly Disagree** in red.
3. We faced a difficulty to include several questions in one game, so we explored a stackable design and fine tuned our initial prototype.
4. LED does not light up at first try, so we changed the code to pin 13.

### Feedbacks

1. One of the key takeaways that we got from the first feed back is to have a bigger size, preferably 500mm x 500mm.
2. Change the languag so that it is more children and teenager friendly.
3. Add visuals to the pointers. We are thinking about including emojis and making them stackable.

One of the concerns that they have is the intentionality of the project, what will we do with each data visualization and how do we incorporate multiple questions on one board.

Edu suggested the stackable 3D puzzle concepte that represent each questions (like the reference featured below).

![](https://i.imgur.com/lK3Zezv.jpg)

Since the concern is to be able to answer multiple questions in one game, we did some brainstorming sessions to see how we can evolve our design. We explored options to see if we can work this idea out.

![](https://i.imgur.com/QMMk83N.jpg)

After several discussions, we decided to create more stackable pointers. We decided to show all results of the 3 questions of **the same topic** so that they can go in depth on one subject area in one play session.

As a group, we further discussed and finalized the importance of this game. We refined the purpose and intentionality.

## Honest design
*Honest Design (use of technology in a meaningful way, in relation to your interventions)*

One of the feedback we received is to try to incorporate electronics to our existing design. One of the suggestions is to incorporate something that will light up our board. However, we think that it might be too distrating for the kids to carry out the activities.

After several discussions, we decided to incoporate LED lights of Yellow, Red and Green as an indicator of the scale so that it is more meaningful and intentional. It would improve the overall User Expereince too and the navigation of the board.


## Exploration

*Explore design boundaries (based on your expertise)*

Our journey designing the board involved asking ourselves a set of questions. Our past experience is on architecture, engineering and UX/UI design. For us, onboarding ourselves on game design, principles of making a game and analog data visualization is a completely new territory. A proposal to include electronics can also challenge us to push our craft a bit futher in a more meaningful way.

Our goal is to explore technology such as electronics, laser cutting and gaming design.

**Theme:**

The participant will pick one of the following topics:
- Gender equality
- Climate change
- Mental health

After testing it, We realized that this is an exercise for older children (over 12 years old).

There is an potential in which we can use weak signal cards for identifying problems and building on top of existing problems.

## Fabrication process

For the Fabrication process, we mainly used the laser cutter to make our perception board.

### First Prototype

On Wednesday, we started to do some prototype. One of the things that we struggled with at first with the rhino files is the duplicated lines. So, to start with, we use Rhino Seldup function to select extra lines and delete it.

Then, we also used color by layer to make sure that the laser cutter can read the file correctly.

We have also exploded our text to make sure that it could be raster. For our first prototype, we used a cardboard as a material.

First test cutting before proceeding.

One trick that we got is to use the vector ordering setting during the laser cut to make our cut efficient.

#### First prototype conclusion

As a team, we decided that the prototype is successful. 

There is a possibility to make the board game fancier, use colored paper in between the 2 wooden boards for greater contrast or build a card holder to feature the question that is being answered.

One question we have moving forward is how can we design a 45 minute session using the Perception Board as a facilitation tool? We feel after doing this prototype that is a great conversation starter but it is the teacher's job to go in depth on a subject.

### Second Prototype

On Thursday, we proceeded with manufacturing the second prototype.We made the hole for the LED smaller and tried a test on the wood before cutting it.

One thing that we noticed is that the power is a little too high, so after the test we turned down the power.

We had help during the laser cutting process.

## Future Development and Opportunities

1. We could redesign this game so that it is more friendly for younger children.
2. Rethinking the scale for this project: can we create a bigger one? Instead of a board game, we can make it an in person experience.
3. Potential to bring the digital miro board to schools so that teachers can carry out the project independently with no need of the physical artifact.
4. Develop the graphic design of board, button and cards (maybe create a brand). Ideas: create a box for the cards, separate the button of the arduino board, a box for the arduino, a base for the board.
